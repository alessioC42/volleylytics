# [WIP] volleylytics
Flutter application to create statistics for a volleyball match and find common mistakes.

## Idea
Monitor players in game, track their actions and find common mistakes. Basically creating a list of actions/events that happened during the game and then analyze them.

### Roadmap

- [x] Player management
- [x] Game management
- [x] Game editor

- [ ] Export/Import games/team data
- [ ] Analytics and statistics dashboard
